Significance of the DOM:
The DOM's significance lies in its ability to make web pages dynamic and interactive. Without the DOM, web pages would be static, unchangeable documents.
Here's why it's so important:
	1. Enables JavaScript to Interact with the Page:
		○ The DOM is the bridge between your HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
		○ JavaScript, by itself, doesn't understand HTML directly. It needs an "object model" to work with.
		○ The DOM provides a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that JavaScript can use to: 
			 Find elements: "Get me the paragraph with the ID 'my-message'."
			 Change content: "Change the text inside that paragraph to 'Hello, world!'"
			 Modify styles: "Make the heading text red."
			 Add/remove elements: "Create a new button and add it to the page."
			 Respond to user actions (events): "When the user clicks this button, do something."
	2. Creates Dynamic and Interactive Web Experiences:
		○ Think about social media feeds that update in real-time without reloading the page, interactive forms that validate your input as you type, image carousels, pop-up modals, or drag-and-drop functionality. All of these are made possible by JavaScript manipulating the DOM.
		○ Instead of having to reload the entire page from the server every time something changes, JavaScript can make small, precise updates to the DOM, resulting in a much smoother and faster user experience.
	3. Cross-Browser Compatibility:
		○ The DOM is a standardized API (developed by the W3C and WHATWG). 
          This means that all modern web browsers implement the DOM in a 
          consistent way.
		○ This consistency allows developers to write JavaScript code that 
          manipulates the DOM, and it will (mostly) behave the same way across 
          different browsers, ensuring a more universal web experience.
In simpler terms:
The DOM is what allows your web page to come alive. 
It's the mechanism that lets code (usually JavaScript) see, understand, and 
change everything you see and interact with on a website, without having to 
rebuild the entire page from scratch every time something happens. It transforms 
static HTML into a dynamic, programmable entity.
