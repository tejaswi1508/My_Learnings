***Hashing And Password Security***

I have learned something about hashing today. Even though i knew hashing will be used
for storing passwords i used to doubt even if they store they cant retrieve and that was true
We cant retrive back the password but everytime the user enters the pasword the hash remains the same
So without exposing the password in the database we simply store the hash. 
Now to make it even more secure they will add salt to the passwords that is adding some extra string 
to the passowrd and then storing that hash as passsword.
This not only secures the password but also Helps in handling people with same passwords
as the passwords will be different when added some salt.
